## Using gatling recorder

Install it directly or run in docker; `denvazh/gatling:2.3.1` works for me.
Installation is extracting an archive and making sure Gatling can find Java.

### Configuration:
Gatling comes well configured out of the box
For cli, preferences are in conf/recorder.conf

  1. Whitelist site you want to test
   -  whitelist = ["^http[s]?://classes\\.cornell\\.edu.*"]
  2. blacklist resources you want excluded
   -  blacklist = [".*\\.(css|js|png|jpg|woff|svg|ico).*"]
  3. cli: `bin/recorder.sh -cli true`
  4. Set your browser to use gatling recorder as a proxy.

### HTTPS
Gatling will intercept https traffic in a way that causes browser warnings.

Fix both the configuration and security warnings by running chrome from command line:
  `google-chrome --proxy-server=localhost:8000  --ignore-certificate-errors`

You're ready to record.
