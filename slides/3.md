# Keeping it below ðŸ’¯

## Actionable load tests
 - repeatable
 - reliable
 - comparable

## Building a load profile
 - failure is only really interesting once
 - focus on comparability
   - if you can hold just below failure, any increase quantifies improvement
   - otherwise, pick a set of criteria fitting your use case
     - latency at a resource usage level
 - for realism, check log files or base scenarios on user stories
   - otherwise, exploit frequent, hard paths
 - keep profile consistent across runs


## Metrics to watch during a load test
 - resource usage
   - cpu usage, memory usage, load averages
     - top
   - disk, swap, network (less likely to be an issue)
     - iotop
 - response time
 - failed requests
 - log files, slow logs, etc

Gatling will measure response time and failed requests. The rest is up to you.
