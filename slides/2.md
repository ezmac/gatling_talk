We will focus on Gatling later on because it is free and does what we need.

## Basics
 - Latency: Round trip time for a response to be returned from a request.
 - Load: Generically the amount of stress put on a system under test
 - Load profile: Characterization of requests and types over time
 - Resource utilization: Measuring consumption of limited resources (cpu, memory, etc)
 - Load tests: Profiling the latency and resource utilization for a given load profile
 - Average latency: A number used to lie to yourself about how great your system performs
 - 99th percentile: Latency which 99% of requests meet or exceed

Load testing MUST consider latency, load, and resource utilization
