# Keeping it below ðŸ’¯


We started tuning the server and seeing what worked.

http://localhost:8888/examples/third/

Best case, we handled 4 more r/s at the breaking point; 6.25% improvement.

## What do these results tell us?

 - 6% more request per second
 - slow logs seen during 1800 user/hour load
 - expect more slowness at 1900 users per hour

We doubled the hardware and moved full text search into the browser.
