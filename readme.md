# Keeping it below ðŸ’¯

A talk presented at the october sd-sig at cornell.

Meta story: Deck.js is annoying, text is king.

This talk will be given semi-informally from my terminal (zoomed waayyyyy in) and a web browser for showing results.  Instead of slides and etc, I used bash and docker.

Slides are numbered 1 through 19; in rewriting slides, I removed the content for 8.  It's left in as a small joke.

In lotek, there are some scripts that might help your journey to load testing.  It was going to be a "LOadTEsting toolKit", but I ran out of time.  Still, might help someone.

If you'd like to pick up work on lotek, hmu.
